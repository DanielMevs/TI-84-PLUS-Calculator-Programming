This repository has code written on my TI-84 Plus calcultor. To write a program, press the prgm button and look up blogs about TI BASIC. You should learn a great deal by looking at my code, as well as learn the different base conversion algorithms. 
The code in this repository is mostly base conversion codes. 
First you'll need to download the TI Connect CE Software: https://education.ti.com/en/products/computer-software/ti-connect-ce-sw

Once you install the software and get the files from my github, you'll have to open up the newly downloaded software open up the files from from my github, put it on your calculator and execute!
